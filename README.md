# tf-idf
## TF-IDF Document Search Engine

TF-IDF is an AI algorythm that makes possible to analyze words by converting them to vectors. In this project, I tried to make a search engine using this algorythm.

- Firstly, I wrote the core TF-IDF algorythm
- Then, I get an API key from BestBuy to list all products in Bestbuy. 
- Finally, I tried to connect Spark framework to this algorythm.
